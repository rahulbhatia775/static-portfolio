                    As a passionate student journalist, I've had the privilege of writing insightful articles on various social issues that impact our daily lives. Through my work, I've explored topics ranging from mental health awareness to the effects of economic disparities, aiming to shed light on critical matters that often go unnoticed. My goal is to not only inform but to inspire thoughtful conversations and provoke change. By presenting my thoughts and research, I've sought to make a meaningful difference in the way people perceive and address these challenges in society.
